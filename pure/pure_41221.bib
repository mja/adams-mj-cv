  title =        "Brain structural associations with depression in a
                 large early adolescent sample (the {ABCD}
                 study{\textregistered})",
  abstract =     "Background: Depression is the leading cause of
                 disability worldwide with > 50% of cases emerging
                 before the age of 25 years. Large-scale neuroimaging
                 studies in depression implicate robust structural brain
                 differences in the disorder. However, most studies have
                 been conducted in adults and therefore, the temporal
                 origins of depression-related imaging features remain
                 largely unknown. This has important implications for
                 understanding aetiology and informing timings of
                 potential intervention. Methods: Here, we examine
                 associations between brain structure (cortical metrics
                 and white matter microstructural integrity) and
                 depression ratings (from caregiver and child), in a
                 large sample (N = 8634) of early adolescents (9 to 11
                 years old) from the US-based, Adolescent Brain and
                 Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study{\textregistered}.
                 Data was collected from 2016 to 2018. Findings: We
                 report significantly decreased global cortical and
                 white matter metrics, and regionally in frontal, limbic
                 and temporal areas in adolescent depression (Cohen's d
                 = -0⋅018 to -0⋅041, β = -0·019 to -0⋅057).
                 Further, we report consistently stronger imaging
                 associations for caregiver-reported compared to
                 child-reported depression ratings. Divergences between
                 reports (caregiver vs child) were found to
                 significantly relate to negative socio-environmental
                 factors (e.g., family conflict, absolute β = 0⋅048
                 to 0⋅169). Interpretation: Depression ratings in
                 early adolescence were associated with similar imaging
                 findings to those seen in adult depression samples,
                 suggesting neuroanatomical abnormalities may be present
                 early in the disease course, arguing for the importance
                 of early intervention. Associations between
                 socio-environmental factors and reporter discrepancy
                 warrant further consideration, both in the wider
                 context of the assessment of adolescent
                 psychopathology, and in relation to their role in
                 aetiology. Funding: Wellcome Trust (References:

  title =        "Sex-Dependent Shared and Nonshared Genetic
                 Architecture Across Mood and Psychotic Disorders",
  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Sex differences in incidence and/or
                 presentation of schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive
                 disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BIP) are
                 pervasive. Previous evidence for shared genetic risk
                 and sex differences in brain abnormalities across
                 disorders suggest possible shared sex-dependent genetic
                 risk.METHODS: We conducted the largest to date
                 genome-wide genotype-by-sex (G×S) interaction of risk
                 for these disorders using 85,735 cases (33,403 SCZ,
                 19,924 BIP, and 32,408 MDD) and 109,946 controls from
                 the PGC (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) and
                 iPSYCH.RESULTS: Across disorders, genome-wide
                 significant single nucleotide polymorphism-by-sex
                 interaction was detected for a locus encompassing
                 NKAIN2 (rs117780815, p = 3.2 × 10-8), which interacts
                 with sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (adenosine
                 triphosphatase) enzymes, implicating neuronal
                 excitability. Three additional loci showed evidence (p
                 < 1 × 10-6) for cross-disorder G×S interaction
                 (rs7302529, p = 1.6 × 10-7; rs73033497, p = 8.8 ×
                 10-7; rs7914279, p = 6.4 × 10-7), implicating various
                 functions. Gene-based analyses identified G×S
                 interaction across disorders (p = 8.97 × 10-7) with
                 transcriptional inhibitor SLTM. Most significant in SCZ
                 was a MOCOS gene locus (rs11665282, p = 1.5 × 10-7),
                 implicating vascular endothelial cells. Secondary
                 analysis of the PGC-SCZ dataset detected an interaction
                 (rs13265509, p = 1.1 × 10-7) in a locus containing
                 IDO2, a kynurenine pathway enzyme with immunoregulatory
                 functions implicated in SCZ, BIP, and MDD. Pathway
                 enrichment analysis detected significant G×S
                 interaction of genes regulating vascular endothelial
                 growth factor receptor signaling in MDD (false
                 discovery rate-corrected p < .05).CONCLUSIONS: In the
                 largest genome-wide G×S analysis of mood and psychotic
                 disorders to date, there was substantial genetic
                 overlap between the sexes. However, significant
                 sex-dependent effects were enriched for genes related
                 to neuronal development and immune and vascular
                 functions across and within SCZ, BIP, and MDD at the
                 variant, gene, and pathway levels.",

  title =        "Characterisation of age and polarity at onset in
                 bipolar disorder",
  abstract =     "Background Studying phenotypic and genetic
                 characteristics of age at onset (AAO) and polarity at
                 onset (PAO) in bipolar disorder can provide new
                 insights into disease pathology and facilitate the
                 development of screening tools. Aims To examine the
                 genetic architecture of AAO and PAO and their
                 association with bipolar disorder disease
                 characteristics. Method Genome-wide association studies
                 (GWASs) and polygenic score (PGS) analyses of AAO (n =
                 12 977) and PAO (n = 6773) were conducted in patients
                 with bipolar disorder from 34 cohorts and a replication
                 sample (n = 2237). The association of onset with
                 disease characteristics was investigated in two of
                 these cohorts. Results Earlier AAO was associated with
                 a higher probability of psychotic symptoms,
                 suicidality, lower educational attainment, not living
                 together and fewer episodes. Depressive onset
                 correlated with suicidality and manic onset correlated
                 with delusions and manic episodes. Systematic
                 differences in AAO between cohorts and continents of
                 origin were observed. This was also reflected in
                 single-nucleotide variant-based heritability estimates,
                 with higher heritabilities for stricter onset
                 definitions. Increased PGS for autism spectrum disorder
                 (β = −0.34 years, s.e. = 0.08), major depression (β
                 = −0.34 years, s.e. = 0.08), schizophrenia (β =
                 −0.39 years, s.e. = 0.08), and educational attainment
                 (β = −0.31 years, s.e. = 0.08) were associated with
                 an earlier AAO. The AAO GWAS identified one significant
                 locus, but this finding did not replicate. Neither GWAS
                 nor PGS analyses yielded significant associations with
                 PAO. Conclusions AAO and PAO are associated with
                 indicators of bipolar disorder severity. Individuals
                 with an earlier onset show an increased polygenic
                 liability for a broad spectrum of psychiatric traits.
                 Systematic differences in AAO across cohorts,
                 continents and phenotype definitions introduce
                 significant heterogeneity, affecting analyses.",

                 Genome-wide Association Analyses of More Than 185,000
                 Cases and 439,000 Controls",
  abstract =     "Background: Mood disorders (including major depressive
                 disorder and bipolar disorder) affect 10% to 20% of the
                 population. They range from brief, mild episodes to
                 severe, incapacitating conditions that markedly impact
                 lives. Multiple approaches have shown considerable
                 sharing of risk factors across mood disorders despite
                 their diagnostic distinction. Methods: To clarify the
                 shared molecular genetic basis of major depressive
                 disorder and bipolar disorder and to highlight
                 disorder-specific associations, we meta-analyzed data
                 from the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
                 genome-wide association studies of major depression
                 (including data from 23andMe) and bipolar disorder, and
                 an additional major depressive disorder cohort from UK
                 Biobank (total: 185,285 cases, 439,741 controls;
                 nonoverlapping N = 609,424). Results: Seventy-three
                 loci reached genome-wide significance in the
                 meta-analysis, including 15 that are novel for mood
                 disorders. More loci from the Psychiatric Genomics
                 Consortium analysis of major depression than from that
                 for bipolar disorder reached genome-wide significance.
                 Genetic correlations revealed that type 2 bipolar
                 disorder correlates strongly with recurrent and
                 single-episode major depressive disorder. Systems
                 biology analyses highlight both similarities and
                 differences between the mood disorders, particularly in
                 the mouse brain cell types implicated by the expression
                 patterns of associated genes. The mood disorders also
                 differ in their genetic correlation with educational
                 attainment—the relationship is positive in bipolar
                 disorder but negative in major depressive disorder.
                 Conclusions: The mood disorders share several genetic
                 associations, and genetic studies of major depressive
                 disorder and bipolar disorder can be combined
                 effectively to enable the discovery of variants not
                 identified by studying either disorder alone. However,
                 we demonstrate several differences between these
                 disorders. Analyzing subtypes of major depressive
                 disorder and bipolar disorder provides evidence for a
                 genetic mood disorders spectrum.",

                 non-overlapping Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)

                 scores for depression (depression-PRS) in a discovery
                 (N = 10,674) and replication (N = 11,214)
                 imaging sample from UK Biobank. We report 77 traits
                 that are significantly associated with depression-PRS,
                 in both discovery and replication analyses. Mendelian
                 Randomisation analysis supports a potential causal
                 effect of liability to depression on brain white matter
                 microstructure (β: 0.125 to 0.868, pFDR < 0.043).
                 Several behavioural traits are also associated with

                 in male anxiety and ethanol intake",
  abstract =     "Excessive alcohol intake is associated with 5.9% of
                 global deaths. However, this figure is especially acute
                 in men such that 7.6% of deaths can be attributed to
                 alcohol intake. Previous studies identified a
                 significant interaction between genotypes of the
                 galanin (GAL) gene with anxiety and alcohol abuse in
                 different male populations but were unable to define a
                 mechanism. To address these issues the current study
                 analysed the human UK Biobank cohort and identified a
                 significant interaction (n = 115,865;
                 p = 0.0007) between allelic variation (GG or CA
                 genotypes) in the highly conserved human GAL5.1
                 enhancer, alcohol intake (AUDIT questionnaire scores)
                 and anxiety in men. Critically, disruption of GAL5.1 in
                 mice using CRISPR genome editing significantly reduced
                 GAL expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus whilst
                 producing a corresponding reduction in ethanol intake
                 in KO mice. Intriguingly, we also found the evidence of
                 reduced anxiety-like behaviour in male GAL5.1KO animals
                 mirroring that seen in humans from our UK Biobank
                 studies. Using bioinformatic analysis and
                 co-transfection studies we further identified the EGR1
                 transcription factor, that is co-expressed with GAL in
                 amygdala and hypothalamus, as being important in the
                 protein kinase C (PKC) supported activity of the GG
                 genotype of GAL5.1 but less so in the CA genotype. Our
                 unique study uses a novel combination of human
                 association analysis, CRISPR genome editing in mice,
                 animal behavioural analysis and cell culture studies to
                 identify a highly conserved regulatory mechanism
                 linking anxiety and alcohol intake that might

                 questionnaire.MethodAn expert working group designed
                 the questionnaire, using established measures where
                 possible, and consulting a patient group. Operational
                 criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and
                 risk states, including lifetime depression,
                 mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual
                 experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic
                 stress and hazardous/harmful alcohol use.ResultsA total
                 of 157 366 completed online questionnaires were
                 available by August 2017. Participants were aged
                 45–82 (53% were ≥65 years) and 57% women.
                 Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder
                 with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence,
                 despite respondents being of higher average
                 socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was a common
                 finding, with 24% (37 434) of participants meeting
                 criteria and current hazardous/harmful alcohol use
                 criteria were met by 21% (32 602), whereas other
                 criteria were met by less than 8% of the participants.
                 There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes.
                 Mental disorders were associated with a high
                 neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term
                 illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in
                 particular were associated with measures of
                 deprivation.ConclusionsThe UK Biobank questionnaire
                 represents a very large mental health survey in itself,
                 and the results presented here show high face validity,
                 although caution is needed because of selection bias.
                 Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other

  abstract =     "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are genetic
                 variants associated with gene expression. Using
                 genome-wide genotype data, it is now possible to impute
                 gene expression using eQTL mapping efforts. This
                 approach can be used to analyse previously unexplored
                 relationships between gene expression and heritable in
                 vivo measures of human brain structural connectivity.
                 Using large-scale eQTL mapping studies, we computed
                 6457 gene expression scores (eQTL scores) using
                 genome-wide genotype data in UK Biobank, where each
                 score represents a genetic proxy measure of gene
                 expression. These scores were then tested for
                 associations with two diffusion tensor imaging
                 measures, fractional anisotropy (NFA = 14,518) and
                 mean diffusivity (NMD = 14,485), representing white
                 matter structural integrity. We found FDR-corrected
                 significant associations between 8 eQTL scores and
                 structural connectivity phenotypes, including global
                 and regional measures (βabsolute
                 FA = 0.0339–0.0453; MD = 0.0308–0.0381) and
                 individual tracts (βabsolute FA = 0.0320–0.0561;
                 MD = 0.0295–0.0480). The loci within these eQTL
                 scores have been reported to regulate expression of
                 genes involved in various brain-related processes and
                 disorders, such as neurite outgrowth and
                 Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (DCAKD, SLC35A4,
                 SEC14L4, SRA1, NMT1, CPNE1, PLEKHM1, UBE3C). Our
                 findings indicate that eQTL scores are associated with
                 measures of in vivo brain connectivity and provide
                 novel information not previously found by conventional
                 genome-wide association studies. Although the role of
                 expression of these genes regarding white matter
                 microstructural integrity is not yet clear, these
                 results suggest it may be possible, in future, to map
                 potential trait- and disease-associated eQTL to in vivo
                 brain connectivity and better understand the mechanisms
                 of psychiatric disorders and brain traits, and their

  title =        "The role of neuroticism in self-harm and suicidal
                 ideation: Results from two {UK} population-based
                 cohorts",
  abstract =     "BackgroundSelf-harm is common, debilitating and
                 associated with completed suicide and increased
                 all-cause mortality, but there is uncertainty about its
                 causal risk factors, limiting risk assessment and
                 effective management. Neuroticism is a stable
                 personality trait associated with self-harm and
                 suicidal ideation, and correlated with coping styles,
                 but its value as an independent predictor of these
                 outcomes is disputed.MethodsPrior history of
                 hospital-treated self-harm was obtained by
                 record-linkage to administrative health data in
                 Generation Scotland:Scottish Family Health Study
                 (N = 15,798; self-harm cases = 339) and by a
                 self-report variable in UK Biobank (N = 35,227;
                 self-harm cases = 772). Neuroticism in both cohorts
                 was measured using the Eysenck Personality
                 Questionnaire-Short Form. Associations of neuroticism
                 with self-harm were tested using multivariable
                 regression following adjustment for age, sex, cognitive
                 ability, educational attainment, socioeconomic
                 deprivation, and relationship status. A subset of
                 GS:SFHS was followed-up with suicidal ideation elicited
                 by self-report (n = 3342, suicidal ideation
                 cases = 158) and coping styles measured by the
                 Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations. The
                 relationship of neuroticism to suicidal ideation, and
                 the role of coping style, was then investigated using
                 multivariable logistic regression.ResultsNeuroticism
                 was positively associated with hospital-associated
                 self-harm in GS:SFHS (per EPQ-SF unit odds ratio 1.2
                 95% credible interval 1.1–1.2, pFDR 0.0003) and UKB
                 (per EPQ-SF unit odds ratio 1.1 95% confidence interval
                 1.1–1.2, pFDR 9.8 × 10−17). Neuroticism, and
                 the neuroticism-correlated coping style,
                 emotion-oriented coping (EoC), were also associated
                 with suicidal ideation in multivariable
                 models.ConclusionsNeuroticism is an independent
                 predictor of hospital-treated self-harm risk.

                 also predictive of suicidal ideation.",

  title =        "Genetic and shared couple environmental contributions
                 to smoking and alcohol use in the {UK} population",
  abstract =     "Alcohol use and smoking are leading causes of death
                 and disability worldwide. Both genetic and
                 environmental factors have been shown to influence
                 individual differences in the use of these substances.
                 In the present study we tested whether genetic factors,
                 modelled alongside common family environment, explained
                 phenotypic variance in alcohol use and smoking
                 behaviour in the Generation Scotland (GS) family sample
                 of up to 19,377 individuals. SNP and
                 pedigree-associated effects combined explained between
                 18 and 41% of the variance in substance use. Shared
                 couple effects explained a significant amount of
                 variance across all substance use traits, particularly
                 alcohol intake, for which 38% of the phenotypic
                 variance was explained. We tested whether the
                 within-couple substance use associations were due to
                 assortative mating by testing the association between
                 partner polygenic risk scores in 34,987 couple pairs
                 from the UK Biobank (UKB). No significant association
                 between partner polygenic risk scores were observed.
                 Associations between an individual's alcohol PRS
                 (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.006,
                 p < 2 × 10−16) and smoking status PRS
                 (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.005,
                 p < 2 × 10−16) were found with their
                 partner{\textquoteright}s phenotype. In support of
                 this, G carriers of a functional ADH1B polymorphism
                 (rs1229984), known to be associated with greater
                 alcohol intake, were found to consume less alcohol if
                 they had a partner who carried an A allele at this SNP.
                 Together these results show that the shared couple
                 environment contributes significantly to patterns of
                 substance use. It is unclear whether this is due to
                 shared environmental factors, assortative mating, or
                 indirect genetic effects. Future studies would benefit
                 from longitudinal data and larger sample sizes to

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder and neuroticism
                 (Neu) share a large genetic basis. We sought to
                 determine whether this shared basis could be decomposed
                 to identify genetic factors that are specific to
                 depression.METHODS: We analysed summary statistics from
                 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of depression
                 (from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 23andMe and
                 UK Biobank) and compared them with GWAS of Neu (from UK
                 Biobank). First, we used a pairwise GWAS analysis to
                 classify variants as associated with only depression,
                 with only Neu or with both. Second, we estimated
                 partial genetic correlations to test whether the
                 depression's genetic link with other phenotypes was
                 explained by shared overlap with Neu.RESULTS: We found
                 evidence that most genomic regions (25/37) associated
                 with depression are likely to be shared with Neu. The
                 overlapping common genetic variance of depression and
                 Neu was genetically correlated primarily with
                 psychiatric disorders. We found that the genetic
                 contributions to depression, that were not shared with
                 Neu, were positively correlated with metabolic
                 phenotypes and cardiovascular disease, and negatively
                 correlated with the personality trait
                 conscientiousness. After removing shared genetic
                 overlap with Neu, depression still had a specific
                 association with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
                 coronary artery disease and age of first birth.
                 Independent of depression, Neu had specific genetic
                 correlates in ulcerative colitis, pubertal growth,
                 anorexia and education.CONCLUSION: Our findings
                 demonstrate that, while genetic risk factors for
                 depression are largely shared with Neu, there are also
                 non-Neu-related features of depression that may be

                 structure in {UK} Biobank",
  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental
                 disorder with many genetic variants of individually
                 small effect contributing to phenotypic variation.
                 Lower cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and
                 cortical volume have been demonstrated in people with
                 schizophrenia. Furthermore, a range of obstetric
                 complications (e.g., lower birth weight) are
                 consistently associated with an increased risk for
                 schizophrenia. We investigated whether a high polygenic
                 risk score for schizophrenia (PGRS-SCZ) is associated
                 with CT, surface area, and cortical volume in UK
                 Biobank, a population-based sample, and tested for
                 interactions with birth weight.METHODS: Data were
                 available for 2864 participants ( n male/ n female =
                 1382/1482; mean age = 62.35 years, SD = 7.40). Linear
                 mixed models were used to test for associations among
                 PGRS-SCZ and cortical volume, surface area, and CT and
                 between PGRS-SCZ and birth weight. Interaction effects
                 of these variables on cortical structure were also
                 tested.RESULTS: We found a significant negative
                 association between PGRS-SCZ and global CT; a higher
                 PGRS-SCZ was associated with lower CT across the whole
                 brain. We also report a significant negative
                 association between PGRS-SCZ and insular lobe CT.
                 PGRS-SCZ was not associated with birth weight and no
                 PGRS-SCZ × birth weight interactions were
                 found.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
                 individual differences in CT are partly influenced by
                 genetic variants and are most likely not due to factors
                 downstream of disease onset. This approach may help to
                 elucidate the genetic pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
                 Further investigation in case-control and high-risk
                 samples could help identify any localized effects of
                 PGRS-SCZ, and other potential schizophrenia risk
                 factors, on CT as symptoms develop.",

                 complaints that brings people to medical attention.
                 Approximately 50% of individuals over the age of 50
                 report an experience of knee pain within the past 12
                 months. We sought to identify the genetic variants
                 associated with knee pain in 171,516 subjects from the
                 UK Biobank cohort and seek supporting evidence in
                 cohorts from 23andMe, the Osteoarthritis Initiative,
                 and the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project. We
                 identified two loci that reached genome-wide
                 significance in the UK Biobank: rs143384, located in
                 GDF5 (P = 1.32 × 10-12), a gene previously
                 implicated in osteoarthritis; and rs2808772, located
                 near COL27A1 (P = 1.49 × 10-8). These findings
                 were supported in cohorts with self-reported
                 osteoarthritis/radiographic knee osteoarthritis without
                 pain information. In this report on genome-wide

                 risk for schizophrenia in relation to structural brain
                 measures",
  abstract =     "BackgroundSubstantial clinical heterogeneity of major
                 depressive disorder (MDD) suggests it may group
                 together individuals with diverse aetiologies.
                 Identifying distinct subtypes should lead to more
                 effective diagnosis and treatment, while providing more
                 useful targets for further research. Genetic and
                 clinical overlap between MDD and schizophrenia (SCZ)
                 suggests an MDD subtype may share underlying mechanisms
                 with SCZ.MethodsThe present study investigated whether
                 a neurobiologically distinct subtype of MDD could be
                 identified by SCZ polygenic risk score (PRS). We
                 explored interactive effects between SCZ PRS and MDD
                 case/control status on a range of cortical, subcortical
                 and white matter metrics among 2,370 male and 2,574
                 female UK Biobank participants.ResultsThere was a
                 significant SCZ PRS by MDD interaction for rostral
                 anterior cingulate cortex (RACC) thickness (β=.191,
                 q=.043). This was driven by a positive association
                 between SCZ PRS and RACC thickness among MDD cases
                 (β=.098, p=.026), compared to a negative association
                 among controls (β=–.087, p=.002). MDD cases with low
                 SCZ PRS showed thinner RACC, although the opposite
                 difference for high-SCZ-PRS cases was not significant.
                 There were nominal interactions for other brain
                 metrics, but none remained significant after correcting
                 for multiple comparisons.ConclusionsOur significant
                 results indicate that MDD case-control differences in
                 RACC thickness vary as a function of SCZ PRS. Although
                 this was not the case for most other brain measures
                 assessed, our specific findings still provide some
                 further evidence that MDD in the presence of high
                 genetic risk for SCZ is subtly neurobiologically
                 distinct from MDD in general.",

  abstract =     "Background People who opt to participate in scientific
                 studies tend to be healthier, wealthier and more
                 educated than the broader population. Although
                 selection bias does not always pose a problem for
                 analysing the relationships between exposures and
                 diseases or other outcomes, it can lead to biased
                 effect size estimates. Biased estimates may weaken the
                 utility of genetic findings because the goal is often
                 to make inferences in a new sample (such as in
                 polygenic risk score analysis). Methods We used data
                 from UK Biobank, Generation Scotland and Partners
                 Biobank and conducted phenotypic and genome-wide
                 association analyses on two phenotypes that reflected
                 mental health data availability: (i) whether
                 participants were contactable by e-mail for follow-up;
                 and (ii) whether participants responded to follow-up
                 surveys of mental health. Results In UK Biobank, we
                 identified nine genetic loci associated
                 (P <5 × 10–8) with e-mail contact and 25 loci
                 associated with mental health survey completion. Both
                 phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with
                 higher educational attainment and better health and
                 negatively genetically correlated with psychological
                 distress and schizophrenia. One single nucleotide

                 overall direction of effect of all association results.

                 longitudinal measures of depressive symptoms in
                 mid-late life",
  abstract =     "Background: Studies of white matter microstructure in
                 depression typically show alterations in depressed
                 individuals, but they are frequently limited by small
                 sample sizes and the absence of longitudinal measures
                 of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms are however
                 dynamic and understanding the neurobiology of different
                 trajectories could have important clinical
                 implications. Methods: We examined associations between
                 current and longitudinal measures of depressive
                 symptoms and white matter microstructure (Fractional
                 Anisotropy: FA; Mean Diffusivity: MD) in the UK Biobank
                 Imaging study. Depressive symptoms were assessed on 2-4
                 occasions over 5.9 to 10.7 years (on N=18,959
                 individuals on at least two occasions, N=4,444 on four
                 occasions) from which we derived four measures of
                 depressive symptomatology: (i) cross-sectional measure
                 at the time of scan, and three longitudinal measures,
                 (ii) trajectory (iii) mean and (iv) intra-subject
                 variance over time. Results: Decreased white matter
                 microstructure in the anterior thalamic radiation
                 demonstrated significant associations across all four
                 measures of depressive symptoms (MD: β=0.020 to 0.029,
                 pcorr<0.030). The greatest effect sizes were seen
                 between white matter microstructure and longitudinal
                 progression (MD: β=0.030 to 0.040, pcorr<0.049).
                 Cross-sectional symptom severity was particularly
                 associated with decreased white matter integrity in
                 association fibers and thalamic radiations (MD:
                 β=0.015 to 0.039, pcorr<0.041). While greater mean and
                 within-subject variance were mainly associated with
                 decreased white matter microstructure within projection
                 fibers (MD: β=0.019 to 0.029, pcorr<0.044).
                 Conclusions: These findings indicate shared and
                 differential neurobiological associations with
                 severity, course and intra-subject variability of
                 depressive symptoms. This enriches our understanding of
                 the neurobiology underlying dynamic features of the
                 disorder.",

                 which factors best explain variability of methylation

                 effects. Genetic and environmental factors in
                 combination best explain DNAm at the majority of VMRs.
                 The CpGs best explained by either G, G + E or GxE
                 are functionally distinct. The enrichment of genetic

  abstract =     "The causes of poor respiratory function and COPD are
                 incompletely understood, but it is clear that genes and
                 the environment play a role. As DNA methylation is
                 under both genetic and environmental control, we
                 hypothesised that investigation of differential
                 methylation associated with these phenotypes would
                 permit mechanistic insights, and improve prediction of
                 COPD. We investigated genome-wide differential DNA
                 methylation patterns using the recently released 850K
                 Illumina EPIC array. This is the largest single

                 date.MethodsEpigenome-wide association studies (EWASs)
                 of respiratory function and COPD were performed in
                 peripheral blood samples from the Generation Scotland:
                 Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) cohort
                 (n = 3781; 274 COPD cases and 2919 controls). In
                 independent COPD incidence data (n = 149),
                 significantly differentially methylated sites (DMSs;
                 p < 3.6 × 10−8) were evaluated for their

                 28 respiratory function and/or COPD associated DMSs,
                 which mapped to genes involved in alternative splicing,
                 JAK-STAT signalling, and axon guidance. In prediction
                 analyses, we observed significant improvement in

                 represents a significant socioeconomic and public
                 health burden. Several aspects of chronic pain, for
                 example back pain and a severity-related phenotype
                 {\textquoteleft}chronic pain grade{\textquoteright},
                 have been shown previously to be complex heritable
                 traits with a polygenic component. Additional
                 pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an
                 individual{\textquoteright}s overall sensitivity to
                 experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been
                 suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of
                 a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in
                 individuals within the UK general population. This
                 measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a
                 complex trait and its genetic architecture has not
                 previously been investigated. To address this, we
                 carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study
                 (GWAS) of MCP in ~380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our
                 findings were consistent with MCP having a significant
                 polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide
                 Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76
                 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated
                 with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses
                 identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous
                 system development, cell-cycle progression and
                 apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association
                 with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between
                 MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and
                 anthropometric traits, including major depressive
                 disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI).
                 Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a
                 causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally,
                 a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to
                 significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all
                 over the body), indicating the existence of genetic
                 variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes.
                 Overall, our findings support the proposition that
                 chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component
                 with implications for our understanding of the
                 physiology of chronic pain. These discoveries may also

  abstract =     "Insulin resistance, broadly defined as the reduced
                 ability of insulin to exert its biological action, has
                 been associated with depression and cognitive
                 dysfunction in observational studies. However, it is
                 unclear whether these associations are causal and
                 whether they might be underpinned by other shared
                 factors. To address this knowledge gap, we capitalized
                 on the stability of genetic biomarkers through the
                 lifetime, and on their unidirectional relationship with
                 depression and cognition. Specifically, we determined
                 the association between quantitative measures of
                 cognitive function and depression and genetic
                 instruments of insulin resistance traits in two

                 N=19,994) and in the UK Biobank (N=331,374). In the
                 GS:SFHS, the polygenic risk score (PRS) for fasting
                 insulin was associated with verbal intelligence and
                 depression while the PRS for the homeostasis model
                 assessment of insulin resistance was associated with
                 verbal intelligence. Despite this overlap in genetic
                 architecture, Mendelian randomization analyses in the
                 GS:SFHS and in the UK Biobank samples did not yield
                 evidence for causal associations from insulin
                 resistance traits to either depression or cognition.
                 These findings may be due to weak genetic instruments,
                 limited cognitive measures and insufficient power but
                 they may also indicate the need to identify other
                 biological mechanisms that may mediate the relationship

                 physical activity and depression among adults a
                 2-sample Mendelian randomization study",
  abstract =     "IMPORTANCE Increasing evidence shows that physical
                 activity is associated with reduced risk for
                 depression, pointing to a potential modifiable target
                 for prevention. However, the causality and direction of
                 this association are not clear; physical activity may
                 protect against depression, and/or depression may
                 result in decreased physical activity. OBJECTIVE To
                 examine bidirectional relationships between physical
                 activity and depression using a genetically informed
                 method for assessing potential causal inference.
                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 2-sample
                 mendelian randomization (MR) used independent top
                 genetic variants associated with 2 physical activity
                 phenotypes-self-reported (n = 377 234) and objective
                 accelerometer-based (n = 91 084)-and with major
                 depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 143 265) as genetic
                 instruments from the largest available, nonoverlapping
                 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS were
                 previously conducted in diverse observational cohorts,
                 including the UK Biobank (for physical activity) and
                 participating studies in the Psychiatric Genomics
                 Consortium (for MDD) among adults of European ancestry.
                 Mendelian randomization estimates from each genetic
                 instrument were combined using inverse variance
                 weighted meta-analysis, with alternate methods (eg,
                 weighted median, MR Egger, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum
                 and Outlier [PRESSO]) and multiple sensitivity analyses
                 to assess horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers.
                 Data were analyzed from May 10 through July 31, 2018.
                 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES MDD and physical activity.
                 RESULTS GWAS summary data were available for a combined
                 sample size of 611 583 adult participants. Mendelian
                 randomization evidence suggested a protective
                 relationship between accelerometer-based activity and
                 MDD (odds ratio [OR], 0.74 for MDD per 1-SD increase in
                 mean acceleration; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P =.006). In
                 contrast, there was no statistically significant
                 relationship between MDD and accelerometer-based
                 activity (β = −0.08 in mean acceleration per MDD vs
                 control status; 95% CI, −0.47 to 0.32; P =.70).
                 Furthermore, there was no significant relationship
                 between self-reported activity and MDD (OR, 1.28 for
                 MDD per 1-SD increase in metabolic-equivalent minutes
                 of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity; 95% CI,
                 0.57-3.37; P =.48), or between MDD and self-reported
                 activity (β = 0.02 per MDD in standardized
                 metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported
                 moderate-to-vigorous activity per MDD vs control
                 status; 95% CI, −0.008 to 0.05; P =.15). CONCLUSIONS
                 AND RELEVANCE Using genetic instruments identified from
                 large-scale GWAS, robust evidence supports a protective
                 relationship between objectively assessed-but not
                 self-reported-physical activity and the risk for MDD.
                 Findings point to the importance of objective
                 measurement of physical activity in epidemiologic
                 studies of mental health and support the hypothesis
                 that enhancing physical activity may be an effective
                 prevention strategy for depression.",

  abstract =     "Major depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness
                 that is typically associated with low mood and
                 anhedonia. Depression has a heritable component that
                 has remained difficult to elucidate with current sample
                 sizes due to the polygenic nature of the disorder. To
                 maximize sample size, we meta-analyzed data on 807,553
                 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) from
                 the three largest genome-wide association studies of
                 depression. We identified 102 independent variants, 269
                 genes, and 15 genesets associated with depression,
                 including both genes and gene pathways associated with
                 synaptic structure and neurotransmission. An enrichment
                 analysis provided further evidence of the importance of
                 prefrontal brain regions. In an independent replication
                 sample of 1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and
                 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 associated variants
                 were significant after multiple testing correction.
                 These findings advance our understanding of the complex
                 genetic architecture of depression and provide several

                 function aids prediction of major depressive disorder
                 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
  abstract =     "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common
                 comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
                 (COPD) but is often undiagnosed. Current diagnostic
                 tools use somatic symptoms, which overlap with symptoms
                 of COPD. The identification of biomarkers is therefore
                 of great importance to aid the diagnosis of MDD in
                 COPD. DNA methylation profiling has allowed for the
                 development of molecular predictors for the early
                 diagnosis of many diseases. We hypothesised that
                 differential methylation could underlie comorbid MDD in
                 COPD. Here, we evaluated the predictive value of
                 differentially methylated sites associated with
                 respiratory function and COPD in the classification of
                 comorbid MDD in COPD. DNA methylation was profiled
                 using the 850K Illumina EPIC array. We performed
                 epigenome-wide association studies of respiratory
                 function (3,364 participants) and COPD (73 cases; 2,738
                 controls) in peripheral blood samples from the
                 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study
                 cohort (GS: SFHS). In independent COPD case data (56
                 MDD cases; 56 controls), significantly differentially
                 methylated sites (p<3.6×10−8) associated with
                 respiratory function and COPD were evaluated for their
                 added power to predict MDD in COPD to a model including
                 the variables, age, sex and smoking history using
                 receiver operating characteristic analysis. We
                 identified 16 respiratory function and/or COPD
                 associated differentially methylated sites. The final
                 model included 13 the differentially methylated sites
                 in addition to ever smoker and pack years of smoking
                 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62 (95% CI
                 0.439, 0.801), an increase compared to an AUC of 0.59
                 (95% CI 0.403, 0.767) for a model with age, sex and
                 smoking history alone. This model may be of value in

                 blood as predictors of impaired respiratory function
                 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
  abstract =     "The causes of poor respiratory function and chronic
                 obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still
                 incompletely understood. It is clear however, that both
                 genes and the environment play an important role. DNA
                 methylation is under both genetic and environmental
                 control. We therefore hypothesised that investigation
                 of differential methylation associated with these
                 phenotypes would improve prediction of, and permit
                 mechanistic insights into COPD. We investigated
                 genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns using
                 the recently released 850K Illumina EPIC array.
                 Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of
                 respiratory function and COPD were performed in
                 peripheral blood samples from the Generation Scotland:
                 Scottish Family Health Study cohort (GS:SFHS; N=3,791;
                 274 COPD cases and 2,928 controls). In independent COPD
                 incidence data (N=150), significantly differentially
                 methylated sites (p<3.6×10−8) were evaluated for
                 their added predictive power to a model including the
                 clinical variables, age, sex, height and smoking
                 history using receiver operating characteristic
                 analysis. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) was
                 used to replicate results from the EWAS (N=895) and
                 prediction analyses (N=178). To our knowledge, this is
                 the largest single cohort EWAS of respiratory function
                 and COPD to date. We identified 29 respiratory function
                 and/or COPD associated differentially methylated sites.
                 A significant improvement in discrimination between
                 COPD cases and controls (p<0.05) in independent GS:SFHS
                 (p=0.014) and LBC1936 (p=0.018) datasets was observed
                 when differentially methylated sites were incorporated
                 in a clinical model. The differentially methylated
                 sites mapped to genes involved in alternative splicing,
                 JAK-STAT signalling, and axon guidance. Identification
                 of novel differentially methylated sites has provided
                 novel mechanistic insights and supported previous
                 hypotheses into impaired respiratory function, and
                 improved the prediction of COPD risk. However, future
                 longitudinal studies, with serial measurements of DNA
                 methylation are warranted to evaluate the causal
                 significance of the identified associations, and to
                 assess the utility of DNA methylation profiling in the
                 clinical management of COPD.",

                 with other traits at equally strict significance
                 levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found
                 both quantitative and qualitative polygenic
                 heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results
                 highlight biological insights, particularly relating to
                 neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish
                 that GWAS performed at scale will be much more
                 productive in the near term in ASD.",

                 was individually significant in either GWAS, but
                 gene-based tests identified six genes associated with
                 depressive symptoms in UK Biobank (DCC, ACSS3, DRD2,
                 STAG1, FOXP2 and KYNU; p < 2.77 × 10−6). Two
                 SNPs with genome-wide significant GxE effects were
                 identified by GWEIS in Generation Scotland: rs12789145

                 locus upstream CYLC2 (rs12000047 and rs12005200,
                 p < 2.00 × 10−8; dependent SLE) when the
                 joint effect of the SNP main and GxE effects was

                 Scotland; and PHF2 with the joint effect in UK Biobank
                 (p < 2.77 × 10−6). Polygenic risk scores
                 (PRSs) analyses incorporating GxE effects improved the
                 prediction of depressive symptom scores, when using

                 Using an independent sample, PRS derived using GWEIS

                 Despite previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
                 of antidepressant treatment response, the underlying
                 genetic factors are unknown. Using prescription data in
                 a population and family-based cohort (Generation

                 sought to define a measure of (a) antidepressant
                 treatment resistance and (b) stages of antidepressant
                 resistance by inferring antidepressant switching as
                 non-response to treatment. GWAS were conducted

                 Depression (GENDEP) study and then meta-analysed
                 (meta-analysis n=4,213, cases=358). For stages of
                 antidepressant resistance, a GWAS on GS:SFHS only was
                 performed (n=3,452). Additionally, we conducted
                 gene-set enrichment, polygenic risk scoring (PRS) and

                 These findings suggest that larger sample sizes are
                 needed to identify the genetic architecture of

  abstract =     "Depression has well-established influences from
                 genetic and environmental risk factors. This has led to
                 the diathesis-stress theory, which assumes a
                 multiplicative gene-by-environment interaction (GxE)
                 effect on risk. Recently, Colodro-Conde et al.
                 empirically tested this theory, using the polygenic
                 risk score for major depressive disorder (PRS, genes)
                 and stressful life events (SLE, environment) effects on
                 depressive symptoms, identifying significant GxE
                 effects with an additive contribution to liability. We
                 have tested the diathesis-stress theory on an
                 independent sample of 4919 individuals. We identified
                 nominally significant positive GxE effects in the full
                 cohort (R2 = 0.08%, p = 0.049) and in women
                 (R2 = 0.19%, p = 0.017), but not in men
                 (R2 = 0.15%, p = 0.07). GxE effects were
                 nominally significant, but only in women, when SLE were
                 split into those in which the respondent plays an
                 active or passive role (R2 = 0.15%, p = 0.038;
                 R2 = 0.16%, p = 0.033, respectively). High PRS
                 increased the risk of depression in participants
                 reporting high numbers of SLE
                 (p = 2.86 × 10−4). However, in those
                 participants who reported no recent SLE, a higher PRS
                 appeared to increase the risk of depressive symptoms in
                 men (β = 0.082, p = 0.016) but had a
                 protective effect in women (β = −0.061,
                 p = 0.037). This difference was nominally
                 significant (p = 0.017). Our study reinforces the
                 evidence of additional risk in the aetiology of
                 depression due to GxE effects. However, larger sample

                 clinically heterogeneous psychiatric disorder with a
                 polygenic architecture. Genome-wide association studies
                 have identified a number of risk-associated variants
                 across the genome, and growing evidence of NETRIN1
                 pathway involvement. Stratifying disease risk by
                 genetic variation within the NETRIN1 pathway may
                 provide important routes for identification of disease
                 mechanisms by focusing on a specific process excluding
                 heterogeneous risk-associated variation in other
                 pathways. Here, we sought to investigate whether MDD
                 polygenic risk scores derived from the NETRIN1
                 signaling pathway (NETRIN1-PRS) and the whole genome
                 excluding NETRIN1 pathway genes (genomic-PRS) were

                 used two diffusion tensor imaging measures, fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), in the most
                 up-to-date UK Biobank neuroimaging data release (FA: N
                 = 6,401; MD: N = 6,390).ResultsWe found significantly
                 lower FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (β =
                 -0.035, pcorrected = 0.029) and significantly higher MD
                 in a global measure of thalamic radiations (β = 0.029,
                 pcorrected = 0.021), as well as higher MD in the
                 superior (β = 0.034, pcorrected = 0.039) and inferior

                 thalamic radiation associated with NETRIN1-PRS.
                 Genomic-PRS was also associated with lower FA and

                 stress-sensitivity and its prediction of major
                 depressive disorder",
  abstract =     "Individual response to stress is correlated with
                 neuroticism and is an important predictor of both
                 neuroticism and the onset of major depressive disorder
                 (MDD). Identification of the genetics underpinning
                 individual differences in response to negative events
                 (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of
                 the molecular pathways involved, and its association
                 with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a
                 proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the
                 interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on
                 neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants
                 that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in
                 individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression
                 compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of
                 genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N
                 = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family
                 Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide
                 significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based
                 tests identified a genome-wide significant gene,
                 ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor
                 function implicated in alcohol dependence (p =
                 1.48x10-7; Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold
                 p < 2.79x10-6). Using summary statistics from the
                 stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability
                 for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models
                 fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and
                 neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that
                 polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank
                 stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the
                 prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland. This study
                 may improve interpretation of larger genome-wide
                 association studies of MDD and other stress-related
                 illnesses, and the understanding of the etiological
                 mechanisms underpinning stress-sensitivity.",

  abstract =     "Objective:Alcohol use disorders are common conditions
                 that have enormous social and economic consequences.
                 Genome-wide association analyses were performed to
                 identify genetic variants associated with a proxy
                 measure of alcohol consumption and alcohol misuse and
                 to explore the shared genetic basis between these
                 measures and other substance use, psychiatric, and
                 behavioral traits.Method:This study used quantitative
                 measures from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
                 Test (AUDIT) from two population-based cohorts of
                 European ancestry (UK Biobank [N=121,604] and 23andMe
                 [N=20,328]) and performed a genome-wide association
                 study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Two additional GWAS
                 analyses were performed, a GWAS for AUDIT scores on
                 items 1–3, which focus on consumption (AUDIT-C), and
                 for scores on items 4–10, which focus on the
                 problematic consequences of drinking
                 (AUDIT-P).Results:The GWAS meta-analysis of AUDIT total
                 score identified 10 associated risk loci. Novel
                 associations localized to genes including JCAD and
                 SLC39A13; this study also replicated previously
                 identified signals in the genes ADH1B, ADH1C, KLB, and
                 GCKR. The dimensions of AUDIT showed positive genetic
                 correlations with alcohol consumption (rg=0.76–0.92)
                 and DSM-IV alcohol dependence (rg=0.33–0.63). AUDIT-P
                 and AUDIT-C scores showed significantly different
                 patterns of association across a number of traits,
                 including psychiatric disorders. AUDIT-P score was
                 significantly positively genetically correlated with
                 schizophrenia (rg=0.22), major depressive disorder
                 (rg=0.26), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
                 (rg=0.23), whereas AUDIT-C score was significantly
                 negatively genetically correlated with major depressive
                 disorder (rg=−0.24) and ADHD (rg=−0.10). This study
                 also used the AUDIT data in the UK Biobank to identify
                 thresholds for dichotomizing AUDIT total score that
                 optimize genetic correlations with DSM-IV alcohol
                 dependence. Coding individuals with AUDIT total scores
                 ≤4 as control subjects and those with scores ≥12 as
                 case subjects produced a significant high genetic
                 correlation with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (rg=0.82)
                 while retaining most subjects.Conclusions:AUDIT scores
                 ascertained in population-based cohorts can be used to
                 explore the genetic basis of both alcohol consumption
                 and alcohol use disorders.",

                 Cognitive Performance, Educational Attainment, and
                 Household Income in the {UK} Biobank",
  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Cognitive ability is an important
                 predictor of lifelong physical and mental well-being,
                 and impairments are associated with many psychiatric
                 disorders. Higher cognitive ability is also associated
                 with greater educational attainment and increased
                 household income. Understanding neural mechanisms
                 underlying cognitive ability is of crucial importance
                 for determining the nature of these associations. In
                 the current study, we examined the spontaneous activity
                 of the brain at rest to investigate its relationships
                 with not only cognitive ability but also educational
                 attainment and household income.METHODS: We used a
                 large sample of resting-state neuroimaging data from
                 the UK Biobank (n = 3950).RESULTS: First, analysis at
                 the whole-brain level showed that connections involving
                 the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network
                 (FPN), and cingulo-opercular network (CON) were
                 significantly positively associated with levels of
                 cognitive performance assessed by a verbal-numerical
                 reasoning test (standardized β cingulo-opercular
                 values ranged from 0.054 to 0.097, pcorrected < .038).
                 Connections associated with higher levels of cognitive
                 performance were also significantly positively
                 associated with educational attainment (r = .48, n =
                 4160) and household income (r = .38, n = 3793).
                 Furthermore, analysis on the coupling of functional
                 networks showed that better cognitive performance was
                 associated with more positive DMN-CON connections,
                 decreased cross-hemisphere connections between the
                 homotopic network in the CON and FPN, and stronger
                 CON-FPN connections (absolute βs ranged from 0.034 to
                 0.063, pcorrected < .045).CONCLUSIONS: The current
                 study found that variation in brain resting-state
                 functional connectivity was associated with individual
                 differences in cognitive ability, largely involving the
                 DMN and lateral prefrontal network. In addition, we
                 provide evidence of shared neural associations of
                 cognitive ability, educational attainment, and
                 household income.",

                 attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia

                 significant genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders

                 the white British participants of the full UK Biobank
                 cohort (n = 83,677 risk takers versus 244,662

                 structural brain imaging. We identified 10 independent
                 loci for risk-taking behaviour, of which eight were
                 novel and two replicated previous findings. In
                 addition, we found two further sex-specific risk-taking
                 loci. There were strong positive genetic correlations
                 between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity
                 disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index
                 genetic variants demonstrated effects generally
                 consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals
                 of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or
                 mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising
                 alleles associated with increased risk taking were
                 associated with lower white matter integrity.
                 Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses
                 highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible
                 candidate genes. Overall, our findings substantially
                 advance our understanding of the biology of risk-taking
                 behaviour, including the possibility of sex-specific
                 contributions, and reveal consistency across
                 ethnicities. We further highlight several putative
                 novel candidate genes, which may mediate these genetic
                 effects.",

                 accompanied by considerable morbidity, mortality,
                 costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a
                 genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458
                 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44

                 were associated with clinical features of major
                 depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting
                 anatomical differences in cases. Targets of
                 antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene
                 splicing were enriched for smaller association signal.

                 major depression with educational attainment, body
                 mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment
                 and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas
                 major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly

  abstract =     "Depression is a polygenic trait that causes extensive
                 periods of disability. Previous genetic studies have
                 identified common risk variants which have
                 progressively increased in number with increasing
                 sample sizes of the respective studies. Here, we
                 conduct a genome-wide association study in 322,580 UK
                 Biobank participants for three depression-related
                 phenotypes: broad depression, probable major depressive
                 disorder (MDD), and International Classification of
                 Diseases (ICD, version 9 or 10)-coded MDD. We identify
                 17 independent loci that are significantly associated
                 (P < 5 × 10−8) across the three phenotypes.
                 The direction of effect of these loci is consistently

  abstract =     "Previous studies of nonhuman primates have found
                 relationships between health and individual differences
                 in personality, behavior, and social status. However,
                 despite knowing these factors are intercorrelated, many
                 studies focus only on a single measure, e.g., rank.
                 Consequently, it is difficult to determine the degree
                 to which these individual differences are independently
                 associated with health. The present study sought to
                 untangle the associations between health and these
                 individual differences in rhesus macaques (Macaca
                 mulatta). We studied 85 socially-housed macaques at the
                 Oregon and California National Primate Research
                 Centers, and used veterinary records to determine the
                 number of injuries and illnesses for each macaque. We
                 measured personality using 12 items from a
                 well-established primate personality questionnaire,
                 performed focal observations of behaviors, and
                 calculated dominance status from directional supplant
                 data. All twelve personality questionnaire items were
                 reliable and were used to represent five of the six
                 personality dimensions identified in rhesus
                 macaques---Dominance, Confidence, Openness, Anxiety,
                 and Friendliness (also known as Sociability). Following
                 this, we fit generalized linear mixed effects models to
                 understand how these factors were associated with an
                 animal{\textquoteright}s history of injury and history
                 of illness. In the models, age was an offset, facility
                 was a random effect, and the five personality
                 dimensions, behavior, sex, and dominance status were
                 fixed effects. Number of injuries and illnesses were
                 each best represented by a negative binomial
                 distribution. For the injury models, including the
                 effects did improve model fit. This model revealed that
                 more confident and more anxious macaques experienced
                 fewer injuries. For the illness models, including the
                 fixed effects did not significantly improve model fit
                 over a model without the fixed effects. Future studies

  abstract =     "Background: Twin studies indicate that genetic and
                 environmental factors contribute to both psychological
                 resilience and coping style, but estimates of their
                 relative molecular and shared environmental
                 contributions are limited. The degree of overlap in the
                 genetic architectures of these traits is also unclear.
                 Methods: Using data from a large population- and
                 family-based cohort Generation Scotland (N = 8,734), we
                 estimated the genetic and shared environmental variance
                 components for resilience, task-, emotion-, and
                 avoidance-oriented coping style in a linear mixed model
                 (LMM). Bivariate LMM analyses were used to estimate the
                 genetic correlations between these traits. Resilience
                 and coping style were measured using the Brief
                 Resilience Scale and Coping Inventory for Stressful
                 Situations, respectively. Results: The greatest
                 proportion of the phenotypic variance in resilience
                 remained unexplained, although significant
                 contributions from common genetic variants and

                 avoidance-oriented coping had significant contributions
                 from common genetic variants, sibling- and
                 couple-shared environments, variance in
                 emotion-oriented coping was attributable to common
                 genetic variants, family- and couple-shared
                 environments. The estimated correlation between
                 resilience and emotion-oriented coping was high for
                 both common-variant-associated genetic effects (r G =
                 -0.79, se = 0.19), and for the additional genetic
                 effects from the pedigree (r K = -0.94, se = 0.30).
                 Genetic correlations between resilience and task- and
                 avoidance-oriented coping did not meet statistical
                 significance. Conclusions: Both genetics and shared
                 environmental effects were major contributing factors
                 to coping style, whilst the variance in resilience
                 remains largely unexplained. Strong genetic overlap
                 between resilience and emotion-oriented coping suggests
                 a relationship whereby genetic factors that increase
                 negative emotionality also lead to decreased
                 resilience. We suggest that genome-wide family-based
                 studies of resilience and coping may help to elucidate
                 tractable methodologies to identify genetic
                 architectures and modifiable environmental risk factors
                 to protect against psychiatric illness, although
                 further work with larger sample sizes is needed.",

  abstract =     "Background: Stressful life events (SLEs) and
                 neuroticism are risk factors for major depressive
                 disorder (MDD). However, SLEs and neuroticism are
                 heritable and genetic risk for SLEs is correlated with
                 risk for MDD. We sought to investigate the genetic and
                 environmental contributions to SLEs in a family-based
                 sample, and quantify genetic overlap with MDD and
                 neuroticism.Methods: A subset of Generation Scotland:
                 the Scottish Family Health Study (GS), consisting of
                 9618 individuals with information on MDD, past 6 month
                 SLEs, neuroticism and genome-wide genotype data was
                 used in the present study. We estimated the
                 heritability of SLEs using GCTA software. The
                 environmental contribution to SLEs was assessed by
                 modelling familial, couple and sibling components.
                 Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and LD score
                 regression (LDSC) we analysed the genetic overlap
                 between MDD, neuroticism and SLEs.Results: Past 6-month
                 life events were positively correlated with lifetime
                 MDD status (β=0.21, r2=1.1%, p=2.5 x 10-25) and
                 neuroticism (β =0.13, r2=1.9%, p=1.04 x 10-37) at the
                 phenotypic level. Common SNPs explained 8% of the
                 phenotypic variance in personal life events (those
                 directly affecting the individual) (S.E.=0.03, p= 9 x
                 10-4). A significant effect of couple environment was
                 detected accounting for 13% (S.E.=0.03, p=0.016) of the
                 phenotypic variation in SLEs. PRS analyses found that
                 reporting more SLEs was associated with a higher
                 polygenic risk for MDD (β =0.05, r2=0.3%, p=3 x 10-5),
                 but not a higher polygenic risk for neuroticism. LDSC
                 showed a significant genetic correlation between SLEs
                 and both MDD (rG=0.33, S.E.=0.08 ) and neuroticism
                 (rG=0.15, S.E.=0.07).Conclusions: These findings
                 suggest that SLEs should not be regarded solely as
                 environmental risk factors for MDD as they are
                 partially heritable and this heritability is shared
                 with risk for MDD and neuroticism. Further work is
                 needed to determine the causal direction and source of
                 these associations.",

                 semi-captive timber elephants in Myanmar. Data were
                 collected during 2014–2017 using questionnaires, for
                 which elephant riders (mahouts) rated 28 behavioural
                 adjectives of elephants. Repeated questionnaires were
                 obtained for each elephant from several raters whenever
                 possible, resulting in 690 ratings of 150 female and
                 107 male elephants. We started by performing a
                 confirmatory factor analysis to compare the fit of our
                 data to a previously published captive elephant
                 personality structure. Owing to a poor fit of this

                 explanatory factor analysis to determine the
                 personality structure in our study population. This
                 model suggested that personality in these elephants was

                 entity, using 74,461 cases and 149,312 controls.
                 Results We identified 3343 SNPs which reached the
                 genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10− 8. The
                 SNPs were located in 28 loci, with the top SNP of

                 Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been identified. Recent
                 studies of MDD have identified common risk variants by
                 using a broader phenotype definition in very large
                 samples, or by reducing phenotypic and ancestral
                 heterogeneity. We sought to ascertain whether it is
                 more informative to maximize the sample size using data
                 from all available cases and controls, or to use a sex
                 or recurrent stratified subset of affected individuals.
                 To test this, we compared heritability estimates,
                 genetic correlation with other traits, variance
                 explained by MDD polygenic score, and variants
                 identified by genome-wide meta-analysis for broad and
                 narrow MDD classifications in two large British cohorts
                 - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank. Genome-wide
                 meta-analysis of MDD in males yielded one genome-wide
                 significant locus on 3p22.3, with three genes in this
                 region (CRTAP, GLB1, and TMPPE) demonstrating a
                 significant association in gene-based tests.
                 Meta-analyzed MDD, recurrent MDD and female MDD yielded
                 equivalent heritability estimates, showed no detectable
                 difference in association with polygenic scores, and
                 were each genetically correlated with six

                 symptoms, subjective well-being, MDD, a cross-disorder
                 phenotype and Bipolar Disorder). Whilst stratified GWAS
                 analysis revealed a genome-wide significant locus for
                 male MDD, the lack of independent replication, and the
                 consistent pattern of results in other MDD

                 using recurrence or sex in currently available sample

  abstract =     "BackgroundPolygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression
                 correlate with depression status and chronicity, and
                 provide causal anchors to identify depressive
                 mechanisms. Neuroticism is phenotypically and
                 genetically positively associated with depression,
                 whereas psychological resilience demonstrates negative
                 phenotypic associations. Whether increased neuroticism
                 and reduced resilience are downstream mediators of
                 genetic risk for depression, and whether they
                 contribute independently to risk remains
                 unknown.MethodsModerating and mediating relationships
                 between depression PRS, neuroticism, resilience and
                 both clinical and self-reported depression were
                 examined in a large, population-based cohort,
                 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study
                 (N=4,166), using linear regression and structural
                 equation modelling. Neuroticism and resilience were
                 measured by the Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form
                 Revised and the Brief Resilience Scale, respectively.
                 ResultsPRS for depression was associated with increased
                 likelihood of self-reported and clinical depression. No
                 interaction was found between PRS and neuroticism, or
                 between PRS and resilience. Neuroticism was associated
                 with increased likelihood of self-reported and clinical
                 depression, whereas resilience was associated with
                 reduced risk. Structural equation modelling suggested
                 the association between PRS and self-reported and
                 clinical depression was mediated by neuroticism
                 (43-57%), while resilience mediated the association in
                 the opposite direction (37-40%). For both self-reported
                 and clinical diagnoses, the genetic risk for depression
                 was independently mediated by neuroticism and
                 resilience. ConclusionsFindings suggest polygenic risk
                 for depression increases vulnerability for
                 self-reported and clinical depression through
                 independent effects on increased neuroticism and
                 reduced psychological resilience. In addition, two
                 partially independent mechanisms—neuroticism and
                 resilience—may form part of the pathway of
                 vulnerability to depression.",

  abstract =     "Alcohol consumption has been linked to over 200
                 diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global
                 disease burden. Well-known genetic variants in alcohol
                 metabolizing genes, for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B, are
                 strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have
                 limited impact in European populations where they are
                 found at low frequency. We performed a genome-wide
                 association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol
                 consumption in 112 117 individuals in the UK Biobank
                 (UKB) sample of white British individuals. We report
                 significant genome-wide associations at 14 loci. These
                 include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
                 alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and two
                 loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol
                 consumption. We also identify SNPs at novel loci
                 including GCKR, CADM2 and FAM69C. Gene-based analyses
                 found significant associations with genes implicated in
                 the neurobiology of substance use (DRD2, PDE4B). GCTA
                 analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of
                 self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (se=0.01).
                 Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS
                 loci and the genetic correlation (rG) between male and
                 female alcohol consumption was 0.90 (s.e.=0.09,
                 P-value=7.16 × 10−23). Using LD score regression,
                 genetic overlap was found between alcohol consumption
                 and years of schooling (rG=0.18, s.e.=0.03),
                 high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (rG=0.28,

                 association between alcohol consumption and alcohol
                 metabolizing genes and KLB, and identifies novel gene
                 associations that should be the focus of future studies

                 Linkage to National Prescribing Data",
  abstract =     "ObjectiveResearchers need to be confident about the
                 reliability of epidemiological studies that quantify
                 medication use through self-report. Some evidence
                 suggests that psychiatric medications are systemically
                 under-reported. Modern record linkage enables
                 validation of self-report with national prescribing
                 data as gold standard. Here, we investigated the
                 validity of medication self-report for multiple
                 medication types.Study Design and SettingParticipants
                 in the Generation Scotland population-based cohort
                 (N=10,244) recruited 2009-11 self-reported regular
                 usage of several commonly prescribed medication
                 classes. This was matched against Scottish NHS
                 prescriptions data using three- and six-month fixed
                 time windows. Potential predictors of discordant
                 self-report, including general intelligence and
                 psychological distress, were studied via multivariate
                 logistic regression.ResultsAntidepressants self-report
                 showed very good agreement (κ=0.85, (95% Confidence
                 Interval (CI) 0.84-0.87)), comparable to
                 antihypertensives (κ=0.90, (0.89-0.91)). Self-report
                 of mood stabilizers showed moderate-poor agreement
                 (κ=0.42 CI 0.33-0.50). Relevant past medical history
                 was the strongest predictor of self-report sensitivity,
                 whereas general intelligence was not
                 predictive.ConclusionIn this large population-based
                 study, we found self-report validity varied among
                 medication classes, with no simple relationship between
                 psychiatric medication and under-reporting. History of
                 indicated illness predicted more accurate self-report,
                 for both psychiatric and non-psychiatric medications.
                 Although other patient-level factors influenced
                 self-report for some medications, none predicted
                 greater accuracy across all medications studied.",

                 genome-wide association studies have so far identified
                 few risk loci. Haplotype-block-based regional
                 heritability mapping (HRHM) estimates the localized
                 genetic variance explained by common variants within
                 haplotype blocks, integrating the effects of multiple
                 variants, and maybe more powerful for identifying
                 MDD-associated genomic region.Methods: We applied HRHM
                 to GS:SFHS, a large family and population basedScottish
                 cohort (N=19,896). Single-SNP and haplotype-based
                 association tests were used to localize the association
                 signal within the regions identified by HRHM.
                 Functional prediction was used to investigate the
                 effect of MDD-associated SNPs within the
                 regions.Results: A haplotype block across a 24kb region
                 within the TOX2 gene reached genome-wide significance
                 in HRHM. Single-SNP and haplotype-based association
                 tests demonstrated that five out of nine genotyped SNPs
                 and two haplotypes within this block were significantly
                 associated with MDD. The expression of TOX2 and a
                 brain-specific LncRNA RP1-269M15.3 in frontal cortex
                 and Nucleus accumbens basal ganglia, respectively, were
                 significantly regulated by MDD-associated SNPs within
                 this region. Both the regional heritability and single
                 SNP-associations within this block were replicated in
                 the UK-Ireland group of the most recent release of the

                 the most replicated of these being reduced hippocampal
                 volume. Using the most recent published data from

                 (ENIGMA) consortium{\textquoteright}s genome-wide

                 polygenic risk scoring (PRS) techniques, Mendelian

                 summary statistics from ENIGMA and Psychiatric Genomics

                 haplotype-based meta-analysis of cognitive ability was
                 performed, as well as a targeted meta-analysis of
                 several gene coding regions. Results: None of the
                 assessed haplotypes provided evidence of a
                 statistically significant association with cognitive
                 ability in either the individual cohorts or the
                 meta-analysis. Within the meta-analysis, the haplotype
                 with the lowest observed P-value overlapped with the
                 D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) gene coding
                 region. This coding region has previously been
                 associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and
                 Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, which have all
                 been shown to impact upon cognitive ability. Another
                 potentially interesting region highlighted within the
                 current genome-wide association analysis (GS:SFHS: P =
                 4.09 x 10-7), was the butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene
                 coding region. The protein encoded by BCHE has been
                 shown to influence the progression of
                 Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease and its role in
                 cognitive ability merits further investigation.
                 Conclusions: Although no evidence was found for any
                 haplotypes with a statistically significant association
                 with cognitive ability, our results did provide further
                 evidence that the genetic variants contributing to the
                 variance of cognitive ability are likely to be of small
                 effect.",

                 further anatomical differences. In this study, we
                 tested for differences in subcortical grey matter

  abstract =     "Major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's
                 disease (AD) are both common in older age and
                 frequently co-occur. Numerous phenotypic studies based
                 on clinical diagnoses suggest that a history of
                 depression increases risk of subsequent AD, although
                 the basis of this relationship is uncertain. Both
                 illnesses are polygenic, and shared genetic risk
                 factors could explain some of the observed association.
                 We used genotype data to test whether MDD and AD have
                 an overlapping polygenic architecture in two large
                 population-based cohorts, Generation

                 of depression onset influences any relationship. Using
                 two complementary techniques, we found no evidence that
                 the disorders are influenced by common genetic
                 variants. Using linkage disequilibrium score regression
                 with GWAS summary statistics from the International
                 Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, we report no
                 significant genetic correlation between AD and MDD
                 (rG=-0.103, P=0.59). Polygenic risk scores (PRS)
                 generated using summary data from IGAP and the
                 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to assess
                 potential pleiotropy between the disorders. PRS for MDD

                 did not survive multiple comparison testing. AD PRS
                 were not associated with depression status or
                 late-onset depression, and a survival analysis showed
                 no association between age of depression onset and
                 genetic risk for AD. This study found no evidence to
                 support a common polygenic structure for AD and MDD,

                 and bipolar disorder (BP) are common, disabling and

                 overlapping polygenic architecture. Individuals with
                 these disorders, as well as their unaffected relatives,
                 show widespread structural differences in
                 corticostriatal and limbic networks. Structural
                 variation in many of these brain regions is also

                 microstructure, and polygenic risk for MDD, SCZ or BP.
                 In the current study, we found little or no evidence

                 and structural brain measures. These findings suggest
                 that subcortical brain volumes and WM microstructure

                 mental and physical illnesses and is inversely
                 associated with intelligence. Intelligence appears to
                 interact with neuroticism and mitigate its detrimental
                 effects on physical health and mortality. However, the
                 inter-relationships of neuroticism and intelligence for
                 major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychological
                 distress has not been well examined.MethodsAssociations
                 and interactions between neuroticism and general
                 intelligence (g) on MDD, self-reported depression, and
                 psychological distress were examined in two
                 population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish
                 Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, n = 19,200) and UK
                 Biobank (n = 90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale
                 Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was
                 extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each
                 cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in
                 GS:SFHS.ResultsNeuroticism was strongly associated with
                 increased risk for depression and higher psychological
                 distress in both samples. Although intelligence
                 conferred no consistent independent effects on
                 depression, it did increase the risk for depression
                 across samples once neuroticism was adjusted for.
                 Results suggest that higher intelligence may ameliorate
                 the association between neuroticism and self-reported
                 depression although no significant interaction was
                 found for clinical MDD. Intelligence was inversely
                 associated with psychological distress across cohorts.
                 A small interaction was found across samples such that
                 lower psychological distress associates with higher
                 intelligence and lower neuroticism, although effect
                 sizes were small.ConclusionsFrom two large cohort
                 studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a
                 protective factor in mitigating the effects of
                 neuroticism on psychological distress. Intelligence
                 does not confer protection against diagnosis of

                 novel-object tests were defined by a component related
                 to caution around novel-objects (Ob-PC1) and behaviors

                 components related to consummatory responses (Fo-PC1)

                 repeatability of Ob-PC1 was modest and not significant;
                 the repeatabilities of Fo-PC1 and Fo-PC2 were moderate

                 time of day, season, and distance to the closest monkey
                 were not related to personality. Linear mixed effects
                 models of females older than 2 years found that high
                 rank was associated with greater caution around novel
                 objects. Linear models were used to determine whether
                 sex, age, group membership, maternal kinship, or
                 relatedness had independent effects on the personality
                 similarity of dyads. These analyses found that pairs of
                 macaques that lived in the same group were less similar
                 in their caution around novel objects, more closely
                 related pairs of macaques were more similar in their
                 tendency to eat novel food, and that pairs of macaques
                 in the same group were more similar in how cautious
                 they were around novel foods. Together, these findings

                 Scotland, n ≈ 17,000; UK Biobank, n ≈ 115,000; and
                 the Estonian Biobank, n ≈ 6,000) to test whether
                 education-linked genetic variants can predict lifespan
                 length. We did so by using cohort
                 members{\textquoteright} polygenic profile score for
                 education to predict their parents{\textquoteright}
                 longevity. Across the three cohorts, meta-analysis
                 showed that a 1-SD increase in polygenic education
                 score was associated with an approximately 2.7% reduced
                 mortality risk for both mothers (total ndeaths =
                 79,702) and an approximately 2.4% reduced risk for
                 fathers (total ndeaths = 97,630). On average, the
                 parents of offspring in the upper third of the
                 polygenic score distribution lived 0.55 years longer
                 compared to those of offspring in the lower third.
                 Overall, these results indicate that the genetic
                 contributions to educational attainment are useful in
                 the prediction of human longevity.",

                 polygenic risk scores for Schizophrenia in two
                 independent cohorts",
  abstract =     "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is known for its
                 substantial clinical and suspected causal
                 heterogeneity. It is characterised by low mood,
                 psychomotor slowing, and increased levels of the
                 personality trait neuroticism; factors also associated
                 with schizophrenia (SCZ). It is possible that some
                 cases of MDD may have a substantial genetic loading for
                 SCZ. The presence of SCZ-like MDD sub-groups would be
                 indicated by an interaction between MDD status and
                 polygenic risk of SCZ on cognitive, personality and
                 mood measures. Here, we hypothesised that higher
                 SCZ-polygenic risk would define larger MDD case-control
                 differences in cognitive ability, and smaller
                 differences in distress and neuroticism. Polygenic risk
                 scores (PRS) for SCZ and their association with
                 cognitive variables, neuroticism, mood, and
                 psychological distress were estimated in a large
                 population-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish
                 Family Health Study, GS:SFHS). Individuals were divided
                 into those with, and without, depression (n=2587 &
                 n=16,764 respectively) to test for interactions between
                 MDD status and schizophrenia risk. Replication was
                 sought in UK Biobank (n=6049 & n=27,476 cases and
                 controls respectively). In both cohorts we found
                 significant interactions between SCZ-PRS and MDD status
                 for measures of psychological distress (βGS=-0.04,
                 pGS=0.014 & βUKB=-0.09, pUKB<=0.001 for GS:SFHS, UK
                 biobank respectively) and neuroticism (βGS=-0.04,
                 pGS=0.002 & βUKB=-0.06, pUKB=0.023). In both cohorts
                 there was a reduction of case-control differences on a
                 background of higher genetic risk of SCZ. These
                 findings suggest depression on a background of high
                 genetic risk for SCZ may show attenuated associations
                 with distress and neuroticism. This may represent a
                 causally distinct form of MDD more closely related to
                 SCZ.",

                 concerning canine cognition: How has the history of
                 this field influenced what we currently know about dog
                 cognition? How confident should we be about what we
                 know? Finally, what should we find out next? We begin
                 by presenting two perspectives on canine cognition. We
                 then survey the existing literature by conducting a
                 quantitative summary of over 100 years of empirical
                 work, focusing on power and replicability. Last, we
                 lament the dearth of individual-differences studies in
                 dog cognition (only three since 1911). We claim that a

                 benefit basic science on dog and human health

                 identifies 9 neuroticism-associated loci",
  abstract =     "Neuroticism is a personality trait of fundamental
                 importance for psychological well-being and public
                 health. It is strongly associated with major depressive
                 disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric
                 conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts
                 to identify the alleles involved in previous studies
                 have been limited by relatively small sample sizes.
                 Here we report a combined meta-analysis of genome-wide
                 association study (GWAS) of neuroticism that includes
                 91 370 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, 6659
                 participants from the Generation Scotland: Scottish
                 Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and 8687 participants
                 from a QIMR (Queensland Institute of Medical Research)
                 Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR) cohort. All
                 participants were assessed using the same neuroticism
                 instrument, the Eysenck Personality
                 Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R-S) Short
                 Form{\textquoteright}s Neuroticism scale. We found a
                 single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability
                 estimate for neuroticism of ∼15% (s.e.=0.7%).
                 Meta-analysis identified nine novel loci associated
                 with neuroticism. The strongest evidence for
                 association was at a locus on chromosome 8 (P=1.5 ×
                 10−15) spanning 4 Mb and containing at least 36
                 genes. Other associated loci included interesting
                 candidate genes on chromosome 1 (GRIK3 (glutamate
                 receptor ionotropic kainate 3)), chromosome 4 (KLHL2
                 (Kelch-like protein 2)), chromosome 17 (CRHR1
                 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and MAPT
                 (microtubule-associated protein Tau)) and on chromosome
                 18 (CELF4 (CUGBP elav-like family member 4)). We found
                 no evidence for genetic differences in the common
                 allelic architecture of neuroticism by sex. By
                 comparing our findings with those of the Psychiatric
                 Genetics Consortia, we identified a strong genetic
                 correlation between neuroticism and MDD and a less
                 strong but significant genetic correlation with
                 schizophrenia, although not with bipolar disorder.
                 Polygenic risk scores derived from the primary UK
                 Biobank sample captured ∼1% of the variance in
                 neuroticism in the GS:SFHS and QIMR samples, although
                 most of the genome-wide significant alleles identified
                 within a UK Biobank-only GWAS of neuroticism were not
                 independently replicated within these cohorts. The
                 identification of nine novel neuroticism-associated
                 loci will drive forward future work on the neurobiology
                 of neuroticism and related phenotypes.",

                 cognitive abilities overlap yielding an underlying 'g'
                 factor, which explains much of the variance. We
                 assessed individual differences in cognitive abilities
                 in 68 border collies to determine the structure of
                 intelligence in dogs. We administered four
                 configurations of a detour test and repeated trials of
                 two choice tasks (point-following and
                 quantity-discrimination). We used confirmatory factor
                 analysis to test alternative models explaining test
                 performance. The best-fitting model was a hierarchical
                 model with three lower-order factors for the detour
                 time, choice time, and choice score and a higher order
                 factor; these accounted jointly for 68% of the variance
                 in task scores. The higher order factor alone accounted
                 for 17% of the variance. Dogs that quickly completed
                 the detour tasks also tended to score highly on the
                 choice tasks; this could be explained by a general
                 intelligence factor. Learning about g in non human
                 species is an essential component of developing a
                 complete theory of g; this is feasible because testing
                 cognitive abilities in other species does not depend on
                 ecologically relevant tests. Discovering the place of g
                 among fitness-bearing traits in other species will

                 has been estimated at 37% based largely on twin studies
                 that rely on contested assumptions. More recently, the
                 heritability of MDD has been estimated on large
                 populations from registries such as the Swedish,
                 Finnish, and Chinese cohorts. Family-based designs
                 utilise a number of different relationships and provide
                 an alternative means of estimating heritability.
                 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study
                 (GS:SFHS) is a large (n = 20,198), family-based
                 population study designed to identify the genetic
                 determinants of common diseases, including Major
                 Depressive Disorder. Two thousand seven hundred and six
                 individuals were SCID diagnosed with MDD, 13.5% of the
                 cohort, from which we inferred a population prevalence
                 of 12.2% (95% credible interval: 11.4% to 13.1%).
                 Increased risk of MDD was associated with being female,
                 unemployed due to a disability, current smokers, former
                 drinkers, and living in areas of greater social
                 deprivation. The heritability of MDD in GS:SFHS was
                 between 28% and 44%, estimated from a pedigree model.
                 The genetic correlation of MDD between sexes, age of
                 onset, and illness course were examined and showed
                 strong genetic correlations. The genetic correlation
                 between males and females with MDD was 0.75 (0.43 to
                 0.99); between earlier (≤ age 40) and later (> age
                 40) onset was 0.85 (0.66 to 0.98); and between single
                 and recurrent episodic illness course was 0.87 (0.72 to
                 0.98). We found that the heritability of recurrent MDD
                 illness course was significantly greater than the
                 heritability of single MDD illness course. The study

                 familiar with individual animals are a reliable and
                 valid way to assess animal personality. However, many
                 questionnaires are too long and thus too time-consuming
                 for care staff, precluding their use in large samples.
                 We sought to assess the inter-rater reliability
                 (ICC[3,k]) and validity of a 12-item version of the
                 Hominoid Personality Questionnaire. We collected
                 ratings on 41 rhesus macaques (mean age = 4.59, 2.5
                 raters/animal) group-housed in three enclosures at the
                 Oregon National Primate Research Center. Using
                 published definitions of rhesus personality, we
                 calculated scores for the dominance, confidence,
                 openness, and anxiety dimensions. The inter-rater
                 reliabilities of these dimensions were .78, .70, .41,
                 and.38, respectively. We examined the correlations
                 between these dimensions and a behavioral measure of
                 rank (i.e., Normalized David{\textquoteright}s Scores)
                 collected using 15-minute continuous focal observations
                 (19.15 observations/animal). Higher rank was
                 significantly (ps < .001, dfs = 39) correlated with
                 dominance (r = .68), confidence (r = .71), openness (r
                 = .55) and anxiety (r = -.60). These results suggest
                 that four personality dimensions derived from a brief
                 questionnaire are reliable and demonstrate convergent
                 validity. This questionnaire will be useful for studies

  abstract =     "Why regularities in personality can be described with
                 particular dimensions is a basic question in
                 differential psychology. Nonhuman primates can also be
                 characterized in terms of personality structure.
                 Comparative approaches can help reveal phylogenetic
                 constraints and social and ecological patterns
                 associated with the presence or absence of specific
                 personality dimensions. We sought to determine how
                 different personality structures are related to
                 interspecific variation in social style. Specifically,
                 we examined this question in 6 different species of
                 macaques, because macaque social style is well
                 characterized and can be categorized on a spectrum of
                 despotic (Grade 1) versus tolerant (Grade 4) social
                 styles. We derived personality structures from
                 adjectival ratings of Japanese (Macaca fuscata; Grade
                 1), Assamese (M. assamensis; Grade 2), Barbary (M.
                 sylvanus; Grade 3), Tonkean (M. tonkeana; Grade 4), and
                 crested (M. nigra; Grade 4) macaques and compared these
                 species with rhesus macaques (M. mulatta; Grade 1)
                 whose personality was previously characterized. Using a
                 nonparametric method, fuzzy set analysis, to identify
                 commonalities in personality dimensions across species,
                 we found that all but 1 species exhibited consistently
                 defined Friendliness and Openness dimensions, but that
                 similarities in personality dimensions capturing
                 aggression and social competence reflect similarities
                 in social styles. These findings suggest that social

                 a function of the individual, but can also be shaped by
                 the phenotypes of social partners. These social effects
                 may play a major role in the evolution of cooperative
                 breeding if social partners differ in the quality of
                 care they provide and if individual carers adjust their
                 effort in relation to that of other carers. When
                 applying social effects models to wild study systems,
                 it is also important to explore sources of individual
                 plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We
                 studied offspring provisioning rates of parents and
                 helpers in a wild population of long-tailed tits
                 Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic

                 importance of examining environmental and genetic
                 sources of social effects, the framework we present is
                 entirely general, enabling a greater understanding of

  abstract =     "Inclusive fitness theory provides the conceptual
                 framework for our current understanding of social
                 evolution, and empirical studies suggest that kin
                 selection is a critical process in the evolution of
                 animal sociality. A key prediction of inclusive fitness
                 theory is that altruistic behaviour evolves when the
                 costs incurred by an altruist (c) are outweighed by the
                 benefit to the recipient (b), weighted by the
                 relatedness of altruist to recipient (r), i.e.
                 Hamilton's rule rb> c. Despite its central importance
                 in social evolution theory, there have been relatively
                 few empirical tests of Hamilton's rule, and hardly any
                 among cooperatively breeding vertebrates, leading some
                 authors to question its utility. Here, we use data from
                 a long-term study of cooperatively breeding long-tailed
                 tits Aegithalos caudatus to examine whether helping
                 behaviour satisfies Hamilton's condition for the

                 altruistic because they incur survival costs through
                 the provision of alloparental care for offspring.
                 However, they also accrue substantial benefits through
                 increased survival of related breeders and offspring,
                 and despite the low average relatedness of helpers to
                 recipients, these benefits of helping outweigh the
                 costs incurred.We conclude that Hamilton's rule for the

                 estimations of genetic and phenotypic effects on
                 phenotypes. Beyond heritability, there are several
                 other estimates that can be made with behavior genetic
                 models of interest to primatologists. Some of these
                 estimates are feasible with primate samples because
                 they take advantage of the types of relatives available
                 to compare in primate species and because most
                 behaviors are expressed orders of magnitude more often
                 and in a greater variety of contexts than morphological
                 or life-history traits. The hypotheses that can be

                 hypotheses that will be difficult to achieve in
