	abstract = {Major Depression (MD) is a prevalent, disabling and life-limiting condition. The neurobiological associations of genetic risk for MD remain under-explored in large samples, with no comprehensive mega-analysis conducted to date. Our study analysed data from 11 separate studies, encompassing 50,975 participants from the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder Working Group. We developed highly consistent genetic and neuroimaging protocols and applied these throughout all participating studies, together with rigorous genetic methods to remove overlap between the polygenic risk scores (PRS) training and testing samples. Elevated PRS for MD correlated with lower intracranial volume and lower global measure of cortical surface area (βICV = −0.017, pICV = 1.97 ×10−6; βSurf = −0.013, pSurf = 4.5 ×10−4; pFDR < 3.62 ×10−4). The most significant cortical association was observed in the surface area of the frontal lobe (β= −0.011, p = 2.85 ×10−6, pFDR = 1.42 ×10−5), particularly in the left medial orbito-frontal gyrus (β= −0.021, p = 9.48 ×10−8, pFDR = 1.25 ×10−5). In subcortical regions, lower volumes of the thalamus, hippocampus, and pallidum correlated with higher PRS of MD (βranged from −0.011 to −0.015, p ranged from 0.002--1.73 ×10−5, pFDR < 0.006). In a subsample of young individuals only (<25 years old, N = 5570), although there were no FDR-significant findings, directions of effects were highly consistent between the analyses of cortical surface areas in youth and the full sample (71.2{\%} in the same direction, exact binomial test p-value = 7.56 ×10−4). Subsequent Mendelian randomisation analysis revealed potentially causal effects of smaller left hippocampal volume on higher liability for MD (Inverse variance weighted analysis β= −0.064, p = 8.04 ×10−3, pFDR = 0.04). Our findings represent an example of how extensive international collaborations can significantly advance our neurogenetic understanding of MD and give insights to avenues for early interventions in those at high risk for developing MD.},

	abstract = {There are striking sex differences in the prevalence and symptomology of Major Depressive Disorder. Here, we conduct the largest sex-stratified genome wide association and genotype-by-sex interaction meta-analyses of Major Depressive Disorder to date (Females: 130,471 cases, 159,521 controls. Males: 64,805 cases, 132,185 controls). We identify 16 and eight independent genome-wide significant variants in females and males, respectively, including one novel variant on the X chromosome. Major Depressive Disorder in females and males shows substantial genetic overlap with a large proportion of variants displaying similar effect sizes across sexes. However, we also provide evidence for a higher burden of genetic risk in females which could be due to female-specific variants. Additionally, sex-specific pleiotropic effects may contribute to the higher prevalence of metabolic symptoms in females with Major Depressive Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex-specific genetic architectures in the study of health conditions, including Major Depressive Disorder, paving the way for more targeted treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Major depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNA methylation studies have, so far, not been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis for lifetime MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1,846 controls). We identified 15 CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance. The methylation score created using the methylome-wide association analysis summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis (area under the curve 0.53). Methylation score was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with tumor necrosis factor beta. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed 23 CpG sites potentially causally linked to MD, with 7 replicated in an independent dataset. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. While the largest published genome-wide association study identified 64 bipolar disorder risk loci, the causal SNPs and genes within these loci remain unknown. We applied a suite of statistical and functional fine-mapping methods to these loci and prioritized 17 likely causal SNPs for bipolar disorder. We mapped these SNPs to genes and investigated their likely functional consequences by integrating variant annotations, brain cell-type epigenomic annotations, brain quantitative trait loci and results from rare variant exome sequencing in bipolar disorder. Convergent lines of evidence supported the roles of genes involved in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, including SCN2A, TRANK1, DCLK3, INSYN2B, SYNE1, THSD7A, CACNA1B, TUBBP5, FKBP2, RASGRP1, FURIN, FES, MED24 and THRA among others in bipolar disorder. These represent promising candidates for functional experiments to understand biological mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Additionally, we demonstrated that fine-mapping effect sizes can improve performance of bipolar disorder polygenic risk scores across diverse populations and present a high-throughput fine-mapping pipeline.},
